1
00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:15.141
Free software is the first battle

2
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:18.162
in the liberation of cyberspace.

3
00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:20.223
Who controls your computer?

4
00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:25.678
Is it you or is it some big company
that's really controlling it?

5
00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:27.786
What is a computer?

6
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.858
A computer is a universal machine.

7
00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:35.125
It will do any computation you want it to

8
00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.405
because you give it a program that says

9
00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.167
what the computation is that you want.

10
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.982
The computer only knows
how to get out an instruction and do it,

11
00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:46.358
and get out another
instruction and do it.

12
00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:50.557
The program has the instructions,
it says what to do.

13
00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:55.252
By writing the right program,
you can make it do anything.

14
00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:57.665
Well, almost anything.

15
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.698
Who gives the instructions
to your computer?

16
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:04.327
You might think it's
obeying your instructions

17
00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:07.495
when really it's obeying
somebody else first,

18
00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:13.953
and you only as much as
that company will let it listen to you.

19
00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:16.049
With software,
there are two possibilities:

20
00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:21.491
Either the users control the program,
or the program controls the users.

21
00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:23.842
It's inevitably one or the other.

22
00:01:23.893 --> 00:01:27.092
In order for the users
to control the program,

23
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.920
they need the four essential freedoms.

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.404
That's the definition of free software.

25
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:38.355
Free software respects
the user's freedom and community.

26
00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:42.394
Now, we often call it "Libre"
using the French or Spanish word.

27
00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:45.716
Pronounce it as you like,
the point is that's what we mean.

28
00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:48.798
We don't mean it's gratis,
we're not talking about price.

29
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.038
We're concerned with your freedom,

30
00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:55.554
and we sometimes say
"Free/Libre" to show that.

31
00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:58.476
Freedom zero is the freedom
to run the program

32
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.239
as you wish for whatever purpose.

33
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.357
Freedom one is the freedom to study
the source code of the program

34
00:02:05.377 --> 00:02:09.717
and change it, so it does
the computing you want it to do.

35
00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:11.449
But what is the source code?

36
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.576
Every program typically
will have two forms.

37
00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.390
There's the form that you can read,
and you can understand

38
00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.485
if you know the programming language.

39
00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:21.929
That's the source.

40
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.321
That's what programmers write and change.

41
00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:27.222
Then, there's the executable,
which is a bunch of numbers

42
00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:29.583
which even a programmer can't figure out.

43
00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:31.583
If all you get is the executable,

44
00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:34.982
it's a horrible pain in the neck
to the figure out what it does,

45
00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:36.866
and even harder to change it.

46
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.069
So, to give you the real possibility
to study and change it,

47
00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.941
they've got to give you the source code.

48
00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.621
That's a requirement.

49
00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.453
With those two freedoms,

50
00:02:47.464 --> 00:02:50.301
each user separately can make a copy

51
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:54.091
and start changing it
and make it do what she wants.

52
00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:56.746
That's individual control.

53
00:02:56.754 --> 00:02:58.914
But what if you're not a programmer?

54
00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:01.703
You look at the source code,
and you don't understand it.

55
00:03:01.743 --> 00:03:04.783
Individual control isn't enough.

56
00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:06.962
We also need collective control,

57
00:03:06.975 --> 00:03:10.363
which means any group of users
are free to work together

58
00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.914
to adapt the program to what they want.

59
00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.026
Of course, in the group,
some of them are programmers.

60
00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.721
They're the ones who
actually write the changes,

61
00:03:18.722 --> 00:03:20.839
but they're doing it as part of the group

62
00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.608
for what the group wants.

63
00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:25.388
Of course, the group
doesn't have to be everybody.

64
00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.586
Others can use it some other way.

65
00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:30.131
They're all free to do that.

66
00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:33.501
Collective control requires
two more essential freedoms.

67
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.976
Freedom two is the freedom
to redistribute exact copies,

68
00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:38.927
to make the copies and then give them away

69
00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:41.026
or sell them when you wish.

70
00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.012
Freedom three is similar,

71
00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:45.276
but it's for your modified versions.

72
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.172
You're free to make copies, and then
give them or sell them when you wish.

73
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.202
If you do have these freedoms,
then it's free software,

74
00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:54.093
the users control the program.

75
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.785
But if any of those freedoms is missing,

76
00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.537
then the users don't control the program.

77
00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:05.580
Instead, the program controls the users
and the developer controls the program.

78
00:04:05.594 --> 00:04:10.632
So, that means this program
is an instrument of unjust power

79
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.539
for its developer over the users.

80
00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:17.500
That means the users don't have freedom,

81
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.797
that's non‑free, proprietary software
which we've got to get rid of.

82
00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:25.262
When you've got proprietary software,
what happens?

83
00:04:25.274 --> 00:04:29.102
Sometimes, the program snoops on the user.

84
00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:32.219
Sometimes, it tracks the user.

85
00:04:32.282 --> 00:04:35.235
Sometimes, it restricts the user,

86
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.178
and stops users from doing
what they want to do.

87
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.297
You can see that the blue ray
is your enemy.

88
00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:42.347
[Laughter]

89
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.994
Sometimes, the software
remotely deletes books

90
00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:49.115
as Amazon did with "Nineteen Eighty-Four".

91
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.764
Sometimes, the developer compels users

92
00:04:54.848 --> 00:04:58.405
to install a harmful upgrade,

93
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:01.529
by threatening to take away
other functionality

94
00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:04.668
if it's not installed, as Sony did.

95
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.443
Sometimes, they can even forcibly change
the software at a distance

96
00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:14.631
as Microsoft can with Windows
through the universal back door.

97
00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:18.175
Sometimes, they even sabotage users,

98
00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:23.370
as Microsoft does when it tells
the NSA about bugs in Windows,

99
00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:26.673
so it can use them
to attack people's computers.

100
00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:30.751
What you get is basically,
with proprietary software,

101
00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:33.795
the owner has power over the users,

102
00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:36.034
and takes advantage of this power,

103
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.906
putting in those various
malicious functionalities

104
00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:41.937
to hurt the users.

105
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:44.916
Of course, they don't do this
because they're sadists;

106
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.719
they're doing it just
for money, for greed.

107
00:05:47.738 --> 00:05:51.111
They have various ways
that they can profit

108
00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.759
from having this power over users,

109
00:05:53.794 --> 00:05:58.355
which does not make it
even the tiniest bit less evil.

110
00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:00.253
But they have no shame about it.

111
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.010
They have conferences where
they talk about the latest ways

112
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:08.374
they can take advantage of users
through the power they have.

113
00:06:08.397 --> 00:06:11.077
Basically, proprietary software,

114
00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:15.823
which is now for almost all of the users
of proprietary software,

115
00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:18.595
they're using proprietary malware.

116
00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:21.020
It's "software for suckers".

117
00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:24.812
How do you stop being the victim?

118
00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:28.931
Formerly, you had to stop using computers,
but not anymore.

119
00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:34.265
Now, you can come join us
in the free world that we've built.

120
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.120
In 1983, I announced I would develop

121
00:06:38.172 --> 00:06:41.821
a completely free software
operating system called GNU.

122
00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:45.415
In 1992, we had it almost finished,

123
00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.179
but one piece was missing, the kernel.

124
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.546
Linus Torvalds, in that year,
freed his kernel, Linux,

125
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.188
which filled the last gap,
and gave us

126
00:06:55.195 --> 00:07:00.045
the first complete system
you could run on a PC: GNU/Linux.

127
00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:07.403
Unfortunately, having freedom at one point
doesn't guarantee you'll keep it.

128
00:07:07.415 --> 00:07:11.408
There are over a thousand
different variants of GNU/Linux.

129
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.418
They're called distributions.

130
00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:16.279
A few of them are entirely free software;

131
00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.959
most of them have non‑free software added,

132
00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:22.584
because they're maintained by people
who aren't concerned about freedom.

133
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.860
They'd rather add convenience --
but at the cost of freedom.

134
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.969
So you have to check
which is a free distro.

135
00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:33.753
To keep your freedom,
sometimes requires a sacrifice,

136
00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:37.728
sometimes a big sacrifice,
as at Lexington.

137
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.959
But in our campaign,
they tend to be little sacrifices.

138
00:07:43.977 --> 00:07:48.337
Anybody with a little bit of maturity
can make these sacrifices.

139
00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:52.681
For instance, you want applications,
but some of them are non‑free.

140
00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.398
If you want freedom,
you've got to do without them.

141
00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:58.063
There may be some inconveniences

142
00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:01.324
you have to suffer
for your freedom's sake.

143
00:08:01.354 --> 00:08:05.851
Then, many websites
send non‑free programs,

144
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:09.174
written in JavaScript,
to the user's browser.

145
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:11.422
If you don't want
to run non‑free programs,

146
00:08:11.438 --> 00:08:13.878
you should install LibreJS

147
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.571
which blocks, keeps out,
non‑free JavaScript.

148
00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:21.902
Sometimes, servers will offer
to do your computing.

149
00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:24.254
They say, "Send us all your data."

150
00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:26.099
Obviously, for suckers.

151
00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:30.211
Then the server does the computing,
and sends you back the results.

152
00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:32.866
But you're not supposed
to think about what's happening,

153
00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:37.537
because it's a "cloud",
and you don't see what's going on.

154
00:08:37.554 --> 00:08:39.188
Well, you should look.

155
00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:42.486
It's service as a software substitute,

156
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.303
and it takes away control
of your computing.

157
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:50.037
A large fraction of
the world's web servers

158
00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:53.139
are running GNU/Linux
and other free software.

159
00:08:53.145 --> 00:08:56.984
But I think the most important
computers to put freedom in

160
00:08:57.012 --> 00:09:00.768
are your computers,
not companies' web servers.

161
00:09:00.792 --> 00:09:02.612
They deserve freedom, also.

162
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.943
But above all, it's people
that deserve freedom.

163
00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:08.879
So we need to advance,

164
00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:12.294
and to do that,
we have to cross obstacles.

165
00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:14.547
One of them is there are big companies

166
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.641
that make a lot of money
by having control over users.

167
00:09:17.663 --> 00:09:19.875
They don't want to let us advance.

168
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.850
We have to overcome their opposition.

169
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.280
Another is that the mainstream media
don't talk about free software.

170
00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:32.359
They have a term that they use
to bury these ethical issues.

171
00:09:32.386 --> 00:09:35.238
They say "open source" instead.

172
00:09:35.266 --> 00:09:39.459
Now, it talks about more
or less the same programs,

173
00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:41.396
but with different ideas.

174
00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:43.655
Where free software activists say,

175
00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:45.587
"This is a matter of right and wrong.

176
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:47.857
Users deserve freedom.
We demand freedom."

177
00:09:47.873 --> 00:09:50.757
The people who say open source,
they don't want to say that.

178
00:09:50.776 --> 00:09:52.176
Instead, they say,

179
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.778
"Let the users change
the software and redistribute it,

180
00:09:55.842 --> 00:09:57.629
and they'll make the code better.

181
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.161
They'll fix some bugs."

182
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.427
It may be true, but it's
a less important issue.

183
00:10:01.438 --> 00:10:04.709
If we want to keep our freedom,
we've got to talk about freedom.

184
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:08.327
So say, "free software,"
and you're helping us every time.

185
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.688
Another obstacle is that lots
of schools teach non‑free software,

186
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.242
which is basically like teaching
the kids to smoke tobacco.

187
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:18.226
It's implanting dependence,

188
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:20.560
which is the opposite
of what schools should do.

189
00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:24.571
A school should prepare citizens to live

190
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:30.903
in a strong, capable, independent,
cooperating and free society,

191
00:10:30.914 --> 00:10:34.553
which means, teaching
free software in the school.

192
00:10:34.573 --> 00:10:37.466
But there's another reason
to do that for education.

193
00:10:37.483 --> 00:10:40.776
Some kids want to become programmers,
they're curious.

194
00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:42.662
They want to know how the programs work.

195
00:10:42.671 --> 00:10:45.671
While the one who's studying
a free software can understand it,

196
00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:49.432
the one who's studying a non‑free
program can't learn anything,

197
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.194
because the knowledge
in the non‑free program

198
00:10:53.226 --> 00:10:56.493
is withheld, denied to the students.

199
00:10:56.513 --> 00:10:58.827
So to uphold the spirit of education,

200
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.385
the school should make sure
its programs are free.

201
00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:04.284
But there's an even
more important reason:

202
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.170
Schools should teach
the spirit of goodwill,

203
00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:09.329
the habit of helping other people.

204
00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:11.120
The class should say,

205
00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:13.443
"If you bring a program to class,

206
00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:15.838
just as if you bring cookies to class,

207
00:11:15.853 --> 00:11:17.873
you've got to share it with everyone else.

208
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.563
You can't keep it to yourself.

209
00:11:19.576 --> 00:11:23.689
You've got to share the source code,
so other people can learn.

210
00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:27.090
So don't bring any proprietary software
to this class."

211
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.899
The school has to set a good example
by following its own rule:

212
00:11:31.905 --> 00:11:34.562
You should bring only
free software to class,

213
00:11:34.603 --> 00:11:39.291
except as a reverse engineering exercise.

214
00:11:39.314 --> 00:11:41.924
Another obstacle is there's hardware

215
00:11:41.944 --> 00:11:44.681
we don't know how
to write free software for,

216
00:11:44.707 --> 00:11:47.467
because they won't tell us
how to use the hardware.

217
00:11:47.487 --> 00:11:50.202
That's shocking.
They want to sell you the product,

218
00:11:50.215 --> 00:11:52.295
and they won't tell you how to use it.

219
00:11:52.307 --> 00:11:55.781
They say, "Here's a
non‑free program you can use.

220
00:11:55.793 --> 00:11:59.248
Run it, and shut up.
Don't bother us."

221
00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:03.905
How do we find out how to run
that hardware with reverse engineering?

222
00:12:03.918 --> 00:12:08.559
You've got to study all those 0's and 1's
to figure out what they really do,

223
00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:11.390
and write down how to use that hardware,

224
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.379
so someone else can write
the free program to do it.

225
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.693
It's hard work, but it can be done --

226
00:12:16.708 --> 00:12:19.282
if you want to make
a big technical contribution,

227
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:21.247
that's what you should do.

228
00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:24.659
Each new area, activity of life,

229
00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:28.867
can bring with it new human rights
that are necessary.

230
00:12:28.885 --> 00:12:31.302
The human rights depend on each other.

231
00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:32.769
If you lose one,

232
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.550
it becomes harder
to maintain the others.

233
00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:39.773
So, nowadays, computing is
so important in society

234
00:12:39.794 --> 00:12:44.059
that the freedoms of free software
are among the human rights

235
00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:47.177
that society must establish and protect.

236
00:12:47.178 --> 00:12:49.637
Thus, how to help?

237
00:12:49.656 --> 00:12:51.677
You can write free software.

238
00:12:51.692 --> 00:12:54.469
You can organize groups to campaign,

239
00:12:54.478 --> 00:12:58.157
and persuade schools and governments
to move to free software.

240
00:12:58.175 --> 00:13:01.798
You can help other people when
they have trouble using free software,

241
00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:03.687
or help them install it.

242
00:13:03.696 --> 00:13:08.375
You can say, "free software,"
and spread the philosophical ideas.

243
00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:13.279
Moving to free software is the first step
in the liberation of cyberspace,

244
00:13:13.294 --> 00:13:15.408
but of course, we also use the Internet.

245
00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:17.031
We need other freedoms there,

246
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.729
like network neutrality,
and putting an end

247
00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:24.478
to surveillance of people in general.

248
00:13:24.839 --> 00:00:00.000
(Applause)
